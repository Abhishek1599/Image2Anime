# Image2Anime Project

This is a README file for the Image2Anime project.

## Overview

In this project, the Cycle Generative Adversarial Network method, also known as Cycle GAN, is utilized. This approach involves training a deep convolutional neural network for the image-to-image translation process. The primary goal is to convert a normal image into an animated character by leveraging a trained CNN method with Cycle GAN. This method understands image pixels and formations to create a similar-looking image in animated form. Additionally, Instance Normalization is employed for normalizing and standardizing feature maps.
